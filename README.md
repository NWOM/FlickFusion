### Cinema Web Application

Welcome to the Cinema Web Application repository! This project is a full-stack web application developed to provide users with an interactive platform to explore movies, watch trailers, read reviews, and manage their watchlist. This README.md provides comprehensive instructions on setting up and running both the backend and frontend components, as well as guidelines on connecting the frontend with the backend.

---

### Backend

The backend of the Cinema Web Application is built using Spring Boot, a robust Java framework for developing web applications. It serves as the server-side component responsible for handling HTTP requests, processing data, and interacting with the database.

#### Backend Architecture

The backend architecture follows a standard MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, providing a clear separation of concerns and facilitating code organization and maintenance. The key components of the backend architecture include:

- **Models**: Represent the data entities used in the application, such as Movie and Review.
  
- **Controllers**: Handle incoming HTTP requests, route them to appropriate methods, and return HTTP responses.
  
- **Services**: Contain business logic and perform operations such as data retrieval, manipulation, and validation.
  
- **Repositories**: Interface with the database to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the data entities.

#### API Endpoints

The backend exposes a set of RESTful API endpoints to allow interaction with the application. Some of the key API endpoints include:

- \`GET /api/v1/movies\`: Retrieve a list of all movies.
  
- \`GET /api/v1/movies/{id}\`: Retrieve details of a specific movie by ID.
  
- \`POST /api/v1/reviews\`: Create a new review for a movie.

#### Backend Technologies and Dependencies

The backend utilizes the following technologies and dependencies:

- **Spring Boot**: A Java framework for building web applications.
  
- **Spring Data MongoDB**: Facilitates integration between Spring applications and MongoDB databases.
  
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store movie data and user reviews.
  
- **Lombok**: A Java library that reduces boilerplate code in the project.

#### Number of Spring Boot Dependencies: 6

### Frontend

The frontend of the Cinema Web Application is developed using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides an intuitive and responsive interface for users to interact with the application.

#### Frontend Technologies and Dependencies

The frontend incorporates the following technologies and dependencies:

- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  
- **React Router**: A routing library for managing navigation within the application.
  
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the backend API.
  
- **React Bootstrap**: A front-end framework built on top of Bootstrap, offering pre-styled UI components.
  
- **Font Awesome**: A library of icons used for visual elements in the application.

#### JavaScript Dependencies Needed to be Downloaded:

1. Axios
2. React Router
3. React Bootstrap
4. Font Awesome

### Usage

To run the Cinema Web Application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the \`cinemas\` directory and run the backend Spring Boot application.
3. Navigate to the \`reactclient\` directory and install JavaScript dependencies using \`npm install\`.
4. Start the frontend server by running \`npm start\`.
5. Access the application in your web browser at \`http://localhost:3000\`.
